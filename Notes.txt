First, the plan is to secure the web app. When opening localhost:5200/tictactoe, there is no security and it should be locked behind authentication (for testing purposes).

Then, I will start learning about classes of authentication and web apps, then make definitions and lists here

    Notes from 1/8 meeting:
-Focus on definitions of classes of web apps
-may not be React, could be HTML or PHP instead. React is not the whole picture. We want one app to represent the general
-Modern web apps have 2 classes: SPA and Next.js; understand the difference between the 2, might be where the rendering happens (client/server sides).
-JWT is used for distributed app (different parts from different servers). It is just the token.

JWT vs session cookie: major difference. JWT is more modern, session is classical. Same purpose, different implementations. JWT have a refresh and active token. In JWT, the server does not need to keep session/state info in the database. Makes it more flexible.
These answers will dictate which sample to choose for representative case.

In the web app, there is nothing stopping the user from going straight to tictactoe. No security for the app, needs a token system (session cookie or JWT). First focus is to make the app secure.
When I am learning/changing something big, take notes. Especially on roadblocks.

look for projects with licenses in readme -> ask chatgpt about projects we can use. Look at creative commons or GPL licenses. Usually must acknowledge source.

can make a list of sample projects (or web apps in general) of each class type, and note characteristics. Mostly focus on gaining a clear understanding so that my selection is good, so it is a representative set. Also need to talk about this in the paper, will be informative. Know characteristics.
